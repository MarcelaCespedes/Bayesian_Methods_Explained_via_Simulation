# Bayesian_Methods_Explained_via_Simulation
Visualisation and animation of Bayesian linear model for educational purposes.

This repository contains the R code and results to illustrate how Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), a popular approach to estimate Bayesian model, works.

## Background
Hi and welcome to this repository.

Back in 2014 when I started doing my PhD in Bayesian statistics, I first had to learn what Bayesian statistics is and how it is different to traditional or 'classical' statistics. 

After being overwhelmed with equations, theory and tricky software to implement Bayesian models, what I really wanted was

1. A basic 15 minute introduction on how it all works, ideally with little/no formulas,
2. Why would anyone want to use this over traditional methods? (pros) and
3. Understand what are some of the disadvantages of Bayesian approaches (cons)

This repository fills this need for anyone who wants a simple introduction to Bayesian methods, in particular MCMC.

## Additional information
While there are many different links and books with great references, below are some of my favourite references which go into further details of the topics provided here.

_Please note that everyone has their own unique learning style and there is not such thing as an incorrect learning style. For example, some 'mathy' oriented people need to see equations to understand how statistics work. Others (like me) need to see pictures, cartoons and flowcharts to understand how it works. This repository caters to the later approach in learning._
